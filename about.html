    			<p>My name is Al Ryan Dayrit and I am currently a first year in the College of Information Technology and Computer Science in the University of the Cordilleras and this is my about me page.</p>

          <h4 class="quote">"To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge."</h4>

          <h3>My history</h3>
          <p>Baguio City. That is the city where I was born. This is also where I was raised my parents. There is really nothing else I would say about my childhood other than I am a quiet child. You could say I'm an introvert.</p>

          <h3>Me and my parents</h3>
          <p>Right now, I'm happily living with my parents here in Baguio City. There are also no problems that we encounter with our family. Except for money I guess. But other than that, we are a peaceful family.<br>
          For my siblings... I don't have one. I am the only child. You might think it's boring to be the only child, but I would say it's fine and I'm living like a normal person. </p>

          <h1>Skills/Talents</h1>
          <p>Talents? Skills? For me, I don't have any skills or talents. The only thing that I can maybe add here is that I'm a fast learner and I can actually be above average on pretty much anything, like sports, games, math, etc. But I just can't be exceptionally good in something. I always hit a wall and don't improve.</p>

        <div class="right o">
          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p>One thing that I really like doing is solving problems. That's maybe why I love doing programming activities. Most of the time I also like being alone. It's not that I'm anti-social, lonely or  anything like that. Being alone is fun for me. <br><br>
           I like watching korean variety shows like Running Man. I also enjoy watching korean dramas, preferably something that has romance in it, if ever I have the time to watch.
           Gaming could also be here in my hobbies but unfortunately our computer at home is so slow that's why I can't play the games that I want to play.</p>
